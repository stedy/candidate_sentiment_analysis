 Single payer Healthcare is the critical issue currently facing
America. We need elected officials willing to follow the will of the
people by representing the 99% and overturning Citizens United. Let’s
give our innovators opportunities to succeed in today’s job market,
tomorrow’s economy without unyielding college debt. Every child,
every ZIP code deserves a great education, with free or aff ordable
college. I support equal pay for equal work, government jobs
guarantee, investments in green infrastructure, clean environment
and apprenticeship programs through strong unions, small business
creation, retraining the labor force, especially injured workers.  Our
middle class and working poor need prevailing wages now with cost of
living adjustments, and tax breaks for small businesses to off set pay
increases.
We must break down barriers and face the realities that racism,
fascism, fear, and Constitutional Amendments allow for segregation,
discrimination, and police brutality. Focusing on criminal justice
reform, the 13th Amendment, Voting rights Act, and gun laws that
protect people and protects 2nd Amendment is paramount. We need
a fair immigration reform bill equal for all immigrants that protects
DACA, women, children, and seniors.
We do not need another housing crisis, banks and businesses too big
to fail or lobbyists writing legislation. We need a new Glass Stegall
Act,
government transparency and accountability. Trickledown economics
has failed the 99%.
As a wife of a Vietnam veteran, mother of three sons; two having
served or currently serving, I understand the true cost of war, who
benefits and who does not. Let’s address our overwhelming homeless
population of veterans and civilians with long-term solutions, not
Band-Aids.
From advocating for children to defending human rights around the
world, I understand many issues. I will stand with the people and
serve you with honor and integrity in Congress. I ask for your vote.

America, very deliberately, was created a representative,
Federal Republic.
The U.S. Constitution mandated that “The Senate of the United
States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen
by the Legislature thereof...”. This was known as the “Connecticut
Compromise”. The United States of America never would have been a
nation, but for Senators accountable to State- legislators, businesses,
and civil institutions.
The 17th Amendment (in 1913) tore asunder the relationship: “The
Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators
from each State, elected by the people thereof...”. States became
geographic departments of a distant, administrative bureaucracy. U.S.
Senators no longer were beholden to state institutions.
The results have been deep debt, monetary devaluation, regulatory
de-industrialization, high underemployment, income inequality,
ideological polarization, and judicial supremacy.
The State of Washington is entitled to a U.S. Senator who represents
Washington with scholarship, fairness, and impartiality; who works
to preserve our Classical Liberal, Constitutional, Federal Republic; a
nation whose freedom, inventiveness, prosperity, and charity inspired
humanity.
I pledge to do so.

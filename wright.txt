To ensure life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, both
health care and education must be recognized as basic human rights
for all Americans. The only cost effective way to provide universal
health care is by providing a single national insurance program,
including removal of the responsibility from both employers and
employees (private and public sectors, including education).  Exclusion
of private insurance and advertising companies (and the IRS) from
health care would save the American people trillions of dollars in
unnecessary costs during the 21st century. Severing the current
mandatory linkage between health care insurance and employment
would create a major new and sustainable stimulus for job creation
and growth of the American economy. For education, we need to
recognize the essential role of post secondary training as part of our
definition of basic education. Tuition fees in state college systems
must be drastically reduced or eliminated. The only tax policy change
needed would be to begin taxing capital gains at the same percentage
rates as earned or ordinary income.

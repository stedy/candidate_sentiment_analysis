Our Kids’ Inheritance is Economic Slavery. The
national debt exceeds $21,100,000,000,000; Interest Paid is Over
$12,200,000,000,000. What were they (leadership in Washington D.C.)
thinking!
Solution for National Debt:
 Until 1963 the highest tax rates were over
80 percent reaching 94 percent in 1944 & 1945; that’s how World War
II, the Korean War, the Interstate Freeway System our bridges and the
infrastructure was paid for, those rates will be necessary again to pay
down the National Debt.
Alternate National Debt Solution:
 All income to be taxed at adjusted fl at
rates listed as follows no exceptions, no deductions and no credits:
under 25k 7½%, 25k 50k 10%, 50k-75k 12½%, 75k-100k 15% 100k-150k
20%, 150k-250k 25%, 250k-500k 30%, 500k-1mil 40%, 1mil-2mil 50%,
above 2mil 100%.  When debt is paid off  taxes to drop proportionately
to sustain spending. Example; 50% across the board reduction in taxes
would lower the under 25K rate to 3¾% and the above 2 million rate
to 50%.
The Issue of Corporate Citizenship,
 From A Former Corporate Lawyer:
Add one sentence to corporate law and thus create what is called the
‘Code for Corporate Citizenship’. Directors and officers would still
have
a duty to make money for shareholders, “but not at the expense of
the environment, human rights, the public safety, the communities in
which the corporation operates or the dignity of its employees.”
Solution For Gerrymandering:
 To stop Gerrymandering use districts
drawn up using Zip Codes as they are set up now.
Do not allow
 Zip
Codes to be redrawn but just add or subtract a Zip Code North, South,
East or West to get the desired number of people needed in each
District.

Healthcare:
 I will implement a single-payer healthcare
system/Medicare for all. All Americans deserve the right to healthcare.
A single-payer system will reduce burdens on employers to provide
insurance, and will reduce burdens on employees by separating their
healthcare from their job.
Education:
Thousands of jobs in Washington are currently going
unfulfilled as a result of our lack of skilled workers. This will
change
under my education plan. I will redevelop our education system to
meet todayâ€™s employment demands by providing tuition-free college
to all ages as a public service, with vocational routes for high-skilled
trades.
Small Businesses:
 In an effort to grow our employment by small to
medium sized business to 65% nationally, I will propose a bill that
would give tax breaks to Job Creators on a federal level. This bill will
mean zero taxes for Job Creators with earned incomes less than
$100,000. It will then scale .3% for every $1,000 earned beyond that
until $200,000 earned income, when it would then integrate with the
federal tax bracket. This will incentivize small businesses to create
jobs
in our Washington economy and help them flourish.
Gun Sense Legislation:
Washington State has strong and sensible gun
laws in place that must be implemented nationwide. We need the
background check system to work across all government agencies
and across all states, and we must create systems that effectively
execute these laws coast-to-coast. We need to push for the nation to
mirror the guns laws of Washington. Gun violence liability must follow
the perpetrator as well as the gun owner. As a personal victim of gun
violence, my goal is to promote safe storage of firearms. This alone
will save lives.

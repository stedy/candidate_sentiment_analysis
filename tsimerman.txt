Are we better now than a few years ago? Stop Seattle
fascism with idiotic face!
I, Alex Tsimerman, speak to all Washingtonians stop Seattle
emerald degenerate super smart freaking idiot, who bring Seattle to
number
One Fascist City in America
 with Nazi Social Democrat Mafia
with progressive Gestapo principle. That always choose dirty garbage
rats that drink from fat cat toilet and who make your life miserable
and brought us to total collapse. Enough is Enough.
Sound transit, Seattle City, Amazon, Microsoft and Boeing are
working together in what looks like collusion, which will cost us
$200,000,000,000 (~$200 billion) for another few years and
we
all will have to pay for this. No taxes for first $100 spent on anything.
We pay billions in taxes. Give ordinary people a little bit of air for
breathing. Ordinary Americans have lost all power- whether it be
economic, political, media or legal.
People in Pierce County, refused to accept Sound Transit 3. We The
People need to bring a class action and give billions back. City of
Tacoma voted to limit elected officials to only 2 terms. We need to
bring this to the entire State to stop all elected officials from
staying in
their position for 20+ years.
We have two Women Democrat US Senators for more than 30 years
but salary for women always remained less than men. This shows how
a One party system, who looks like Fascism, works.
A One party system is always Fascism. StandUP Washington State
so we can bring us back to normal life. We have enough money in
the system to make life better for everyone without a penny more
from the people. I speak to you Washingtonians StandUP stop Seattle
Fascism with idiotic face. For, Of and By the people! Vote for Alex
Tsimerman!

 Our people deserve better than an ineffective Senator
seeking an undeserved 4th term. We need a Senator who truly cares
about the concerns of
this
 Washington, not the
other
. Unlike her, I’ve
been in every county and corner of the state these last 5 years--and
I’ve heard you! You are fed up with Seattle’s harmful policies which
she accepts and supports--polices that jeopardize our future. You
want a Senator who votes
your
 pocketbook, not hers. You want big
change
now
 and so do I. In this election, I’m fighting for you. And I
need your vote.
My ties here actually began before I was born--when my German and
Norwegian immigrant grandparents settled in Tacoma. While I moved
a lot as a military daughter and wife, my husband and I returned to
the Puget Sound as soon as we finished Marine Corps active duty.
We raised our two boys, investing time in things that matter: our
kids’ teachers, schools, and teams; our work (my husband at Boeing);
our church--serving UW students; and
many
 significant community
needs. We also enjoyed hiking mountains, whale watching and helping
visitors pronounce Puyallup.
But all the while I was fighting for you.
Against
 a state income
tax,
against
 reckless spending of your taxes.
For
 children’s
health,
for
 public schools,
for
 fair elections in King County. Unlike my
opponent, I would have voted
for
 working-family tax cuts,
for
 our
military,
for
 the first woman to head the CIA. I will champion
Washington’s farms that feed the world. I can bring home vital
infrastructure dollars, which she cannot. And be assured, when
President Trump is good for Washington State, I’ll support him. When
he’s not,
I
 can talk to him.
I’ll be your voice. I’ll fight for you. Let’s win this together!

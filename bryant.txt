 As a son of a Mexican immigrant, Captain of a Nuclear
Aircraft Carrier, graduate of the UW Foster School of Business and
currently with Boeing Seattle, I best represent and understand
the economic, political and cultural diversity of our great state of
Washington. You need a Senator that represents you and has the
proven leadership expertise to fight for your economic future.
I am running to stop the overtaxing and overspending by our
government that has undermined your right to make decisions at
state, local and personal levels. Our national debt is now over $20
trillion â€“ that means $125,000 owed by each worker in the United
States! It is irresponsible to continue this overspending and a crime to
pass on this debt to the next generation.
A fiscal conservative, I do not believe that social problems can be
corrected solely with money. Rather, these challenges should be
dealt with in a manner that is compassionate, practical and, most
importantly, encourages responsibility of the individual. Compassion
is an often used rationale for increased taxing and spending, but is it
truly compassionate to offer handouts in programs that trap people in
ineffective government programs and penalize those working hard.
As an American of Mexican descent, I can provide leadership for a
bridge to a common-sense and compassionate immigration policy.
We need to develop a long term integrated national energy policy and
sustained use of our precious natural resources with a focus on you,
your jobs and your future.
It is well past time for change. I ask for your vote so we can work
together to make this change happen.

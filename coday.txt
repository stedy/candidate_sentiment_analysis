 Art, a statesman, will work for Washington State, not
Washington D.C.
Unlike his opponent, who has a long but lackluster record as a
partisan career politician, Art will not take orders from party bosses,
donors, and lobbyists in D.C. Instead, Art will meet regularly with
you, his constituents, and with the Washington State Legislature and
Governor. In this nonpartisan way, we will accomplish major victories
including making our commute times shorter and safer, preparing
for catastrophic natural disasters, and cleaning up nuclear waste at
Hanford.
A career in medicine, not politics, allowed Art the privilege of serving
patients from all walks of life, including seniors, the poor, and people
of various cultural, economic, social, and racial backgrounds. Dr. Art
Coday, a leader, upholds the sanctity of human life and will fight for
healthcare reform that focuses on access, affordability, aging, the
poor, mental illness, substance abuse, and research. In contrast, a
career in politics, not medicine, influenced Art’s opponent to vote for
legislation that took money from Medicare and dramatically increased
your medical costs.
Art, son of a US Navy Captain, salutes veterans and those in uniform!
To honor you and defend our liberty, homeland, and ideals, we
will ensure that our armed forces remain the world’s finest and
most capable. We will make our personnel safer and renew our
commitment to care for our wounded warriors, veterans, and military
families. It is the least we can do; you bought our freedom.
Safety and prosperity require making our schools safe and housing
aff ordable, protecting constitutional rights, protecting property
rights
and borders, establishing trade and labor practices that put working
Americans first, reducing taxes for all, and balancing the budget.
Art thanks you for your trust and your vote. He will be honored to be
your advocate in the Senate.

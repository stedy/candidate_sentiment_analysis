My chosen pro bono work as an attorney is to study the
many wasteful public frauds and expose them. Elected leaders often
support or keep silent regarding these, maybe because the fraudsters
finance their campaigns.
The favorite in this race has done much good. But she is wrong or
silent on many issues. In writing she supports smart meters, which
are flatly illegal, which collect data for resale on our every
electrical
activity. Our goal should be fiber to each home, business, school, and
Starbucks, and ethernet plugins everywhere for computers and even
cell phones. Wi-Fi in schools should be turned off. The new 5G will fry
us all.
I propose a solution to traffic congestion that will allow us to get
around without a car, a van service summoned Uber style, delivering
door to door service, taking half the cars off  the road, the only
solution
that will work and by far the cheapest.
Social Security should be diversified into many diff erent, safe
investments and run as a sovereign wealth and pension fund.
Most recreational drugs should be legalized and sold in state
stores, bearing warning labels, with profits used for free, immediate
addiction treatment, raising billions in taxes, diminishing organized
crime, improving policing, reducing imprisonment, lessening border
problems.
Other issues: Stop drilling
now
. Require Exxon to spend all new
capital on solar, wind, and wave. Lower the voting age to 17. We need
students’ input. Roundup causes cancer, kills salmon, and should
be banned. Let’s become an organic nation. Fluoridation is another
profitable fraud, adding three trillion atoms of lead to each quart
of Seattle tap water. We should sell bonds and construct enough
reduced rent housing to house all. I off er a proposal for election and
campaign finance reform. Radio program Sundays at 8 PM.

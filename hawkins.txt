Freedoms-Families-Faith
Freedoms
 we know are eroding, adding to this is the lack of
conversation. No where is this more apparent than at the national
level where we see the polarization of discussion. Some believe that
passing laws will ensure their voice has been heard, while failing to
recognize that the creation of laws for one, may diminish freedoms for
all. Dialogue is key to understanding the freedoms we have and how
we can best preserve them.
Families
 are at the core of all that is good for this country and State.
This is the primary institution that needs to be strengthened so
that this experiment that was begun by our forefathers continues.
Parents have got to be recognized as the primary source for the
rearing of their children. Teenagers have got to be allowed to acquire
employable skills while in their teenage years. We need to encourage
the strengthening of the economy so that parents can provide for
their families with livable incomes. This must be true for all
localities
of the State. Finally, we need to ensure that social programs are
supported at the local level so that parents and families can have
confidence in a future that is guaranteed to have predictable
challenges.
Faith:
 we need to create dialogue so that people do not feel alone.
We need to be able to step into the unknown with confidence that
answers will come. Married 32 years, we have raised a family of 10
children (5-boys/ 5 girls) teaching them to move forward in Faith.
We worked to become debt free, only to see our fortunes lost as
conditions beyond our control wiped out what we once enjoyed. We
are aware of the discussion that needs to occur regarding Mental
Health and support within our communities.

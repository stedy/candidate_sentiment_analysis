I am Matthew D. Heines. I am not a politician and I am not
a lawyer. I am a teacher and I want to talk to you about the Real Deal.
I am a reform minded Republican. Like you, I don’t trust anyone to go
to Washington D.C. The theme song for my campaign is
We Won’t Get
Fooled Again
, by the Who for a reason. I am not going to tell you what
you want to hear. I am going to tell you exactly what I am going to do.
I will author legislation to stop US government borrowing, grant
free tuition at public universities, legalize marijuana and use the
profi ts to pay for free tuition, grant full DACA amnesty in exchange
for an immigration freeze, develop smart labor cards for migrant
workers, introduce mandatory sentences for hiring undocumented
workers, establish English as the US official language, break up tech
monopolies and surveillance platforms, include Asians, Jews, Arabs
and Caucasians into affi  rmative action and protected classes,
establish
$20 minimum wage at +500 employee corporations, restructure public
schools and allow viable alternatives to parents and finally, establish
the United States as the world’s Education Nation.
There are only two questions. Do you want to keep voting for people
who decide your fate based on contributions from corporations?
Or, do you want someone who makes decisions based upon the
needs of your family, your future prosperity and the security of our
nation? Actions speak louder than words. I am a veteran of the elite
82nd Airborne Division. I am a teacher and an author. I am the Real
Deal. I am Matthew D. Heines. I will Make Americans Great Again.
Please vote for me and vote for yourself and a future of peace,
prosperity and freedom.

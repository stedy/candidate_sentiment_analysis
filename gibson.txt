Freedom First is a philosophy that can apply to all policy
questions. A bill will either increase or decrease our freedoms. I will
not ever vote for a bill that will further take away our liberties
because
the constitution has already been violated and trampled all over by
these corrupt politician.
Gun Free Zones are a complete travesty to the constitution and to the
children who have been murdered in cold blood. There are no laws
that will help protect our children, good people who are armed will
without a doubt help save lives.
Term Limits are an absolute must for this elitist culture we have in
Washington DC. We can no longer allow these career politicians to
reign over our country while they reel in millions of dollars by selling
out the American people.
Protect innocent life, a baby in or out of the womb is one of the most
beautiful and innocent treasures that we have in this country.
The government now often works for big business. Many regulations
passed by this government destroy small business. Many laws and
taxes this government touches often only help the top .001% and
hurts those on the bottom. Regulatory departments such as the FDA
build a monopoly for corporations willing to pay the high tab. For
example, it costs 3 billion dollars and 10 years to get a drug approved,
which completely cuts out all small business or independent scientist
from competing with the giant corporations. This is why our cost of
medication is so high. Citizens, such as Bernie supporters who point
their fingers at the private sector, should also tackle government
corruption. Big corporations have too much say in our government.
We need a fair and free market that would allow normal people to rise
up and compete.

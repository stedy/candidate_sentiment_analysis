"There are Competing Ideologies - Freedom under God
versus Ruthless, Godless Tyranny.” John F. Kennedy,
“Seven Principles that Made America Great -1- The Principle of the
Dignity of Human Life, “Thou Shall Not Kill.” Jerry Falwell “The Rebirth
of America” I, George H. Kalberer believe in the sacred value of human
life: Black Lives Matter/White Lives Matter. Violence, Brutality and
other police crimes make a mockery of Thomas Jeff erson’s words:
“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of
Happiness,”
This Federal Right to Life is not respected by State/Local Police. New
Federal Legislation is needed to protect each and every American’s
Right to Life, End the Police State and restore Democracy. Compel
Body Cams on each and every Cop in America with strict Federal
supervision - all Body Cam information stored on Federal Computers
and available to FOIA requests -
All
 Police Unions abolished by Law -
Each and every Cop involved in the death of an unarmed person must
be immediately fired and banned from Police work for Life both going
forward and retroactively.
I support the Armed Forces of the United States and their principles,.
and strategic vision pursuant to General Douglas MacArthur’s,
“Reminiscences.” Specifically:
North Korea- Kick Jung’s Ass with 30,000 Tomahawk Cruise Missiles.
China - Kick Xi Jinping’s Ass, by Blockading, then Conquering China
by firing the necessary number of  Tomahawk Cruise Missiles to
destroy all Nuclear Targets, all Air Defense Targets, all Military
Targets
including each and every Chinese ship, submarine and airplane
launched from a safe distance  with a goal of no loss of American Life
and with no US ground troops used until after China’s Unconditional
Surrender.

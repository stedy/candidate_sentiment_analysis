Please think of our world as a beautiful spaceship. We
are the passengers and crew members on Spaceship Earth. We are
traveling in space around our Sun while our Sun travels inside our
Milky Way Galaxy. But we are wasting too much money and allowing
too much destruction on our planet. Through prosperity, let’s stop the
population explosion that is exterminating the wilderness.
Using voluntary, competitive, free market economics, let’s raise the
living standard of the workers. Let’s reject the voter supported Big
Government Command Economy that through force and misallocation
produces wild spending and poverty.
I, Goodspaceguy, predict the prosperous future in space will come
through orbital space colonization around our Spaceship Earth. Let’s
start with small habitats, perhaps privately owned by billionaires.
Let’s
join small habitats together into orbiting, international villages as
the
cheapest places to learn how to live in space.
But on our Spaceship Earth, we have a mixed up economy. We
have unemployed people, homeless people, criminals, and poverty
maintained by welfare (a heavy burden for the workers.) Free market
economics can rehabilitate Spaceship Earth by transforming problem
people into productive people within the labor force.
Worldwide we are struggling between Command Economies and Free
Market Economies. Profits grow jobs, but the minimum wage laws
reduces profits, which decreases jobs.
The workers create the goods and services that make up the living
standard. Then tricky taxation takes from the workers and gives to
the welfare recipients. The workers are robbed. The incentive to work
is decreased. The minimum wage of the Command Economy creates
a stressful work atmosphere and decreases profits. Jobs are lost.
Crime and poverty increase. Let’s defend the incentive of profits that
come from serving you, the consumer. Study Free Market Economics!
Abolish the job destroying minimum wage! Choose prosperity path.

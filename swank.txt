You deserve safety so that you can provide the very best
for your family. I have worn a uniform for over thirty years. I have
defended America and our communities my entire adult life and I
will defend you in the Senate. The establishment has neglected us
for too long, and now they obstruct President Trump from keeping
his promises to you. Career politicians do not respect you or your
values.
Pull the plug, Drain the Swamp!
We need to build a wall on the southern border to keep out drug
cartels, gang members and terrorists. Border security is national
security. You deserve to have the ability to defend yourself and
your loved ones. Thatâ€™s why I am a staunch supporter of the 2nd
Amendment and life-time member of the NRA.
You deserve low cost energy to heat your homes and drive your
vehicles. America should be energy independent, and we do not
need to buy oil from countries that use our money to fund terrorism.
We have been paying a national gas tax for decades. The federal
government owes us well maintained roads so that we can drive to
and from work and take care of our families.
You know how to best spend your hard-earned dollars. The tax cuts
need to be permanent. The federal government needs to live within its
means, and politicians need to stop taking so much money from our
families.
We can keep our families safe from foreign enemies by having the
strongest military in the world. Our military readiness decreased
drastically during the last administration, and we need to restore
it quickly. Furthermore, we should never go to war unless we are
committed to winning. If you agree that things can be better, I ask for
your vote.

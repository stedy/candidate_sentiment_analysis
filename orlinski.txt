I am running for office as a fiscally conservative,
independent populist Republican who is moderate on social issues.
I am seeking office because I deeply care about our country and its
future. My mission is to represent the silent majority of people who
feel their voices are not being heard by both sides of the current
establishment; people whose personal liberties, constitutional rights,
and individual freedoms are under attack.
I have great admiration for our system of government and
opportunities this country provides our citizens. At the same time,
government spending needs to be evaluated, streamlined, and
become more efficient. We have more than enough resources to
prosper, although the overspending has caused our budget deficits
to balloon. This spending is not only irresponsible, but dangerous to
our future. We need to reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act and impose
additional reforms on the Wall Street and banking system. Audit and
oversight of the Federal Reserve should be implemented.
We need to continue our efforts to increase private employment levels
and foster business and agriculture domestically. I would encourage
emphasis on technical and vocational education and preserving choice
in schooling. The student loan system needs to be reevaluated. We
should end fighting wars, work on ending corruption, implement term
limits.
We need to continue reforming our trade, healthcare, environmental
protection, and welfare systems. We should work on renegotiating
trade agreements and strive to reduce foreign trade deficits. We ought
to improve consumer protection, homeless, mental health, elderly
care, veteran services.
I would like to see a merit-based immigration system overhaul which
would put more emphasis on protecting our borders, adherence to
the rule of law, and our labor needs. We are entrusted to protect our
laws, liberties, sovereignty, and right to bear arms.
Put America First and God Bless You.

Hi, I’m Thor Amundson, born and raised in Eastern
Washington. I’ve lived and worked throughout the state, and this has
given me the opportunity to talk with people in all walks of life, and
to
consider the variety of issues facing them. I believe that without a
little
more opportunity for the next generation, we cannot have a healthy
civilization.
If corporations move to other countries, they should follow the same
rules and labour practices as in the USA. Stop shipping logs, jobs,
and clean air over seas. Re-think cities’ waste water being discharged
into the Puget Sound/Salish Sea and tributaries. Turn off reactor at
Hanford; stop making the mess. Nationwide public internet access for
everyone and net neutrality. Ban the use of certain weed killers on
federally funded sites. Overturn Citizen’s United.
Picture a state and a nation where your children can afford to live. A
land without discrimination, and where the working person receives
their just reward. A place where worker’s rights are protected; where
innovative, effective leadership inspires; and where elected offi
cials
are chosen by the people, not by their financial contributors. Rather
than propose campaign reform, I’m going to implement it. I am not
an attorney, and I am not a politician. Therefore, there will be no
question about who I am working for. I will lead Washington into the
21st century.
As the first Senator not financed by PAC money, and hailing from one
of the best states in the Union, I will stir the very dredges of the old
guard in Washington D.C., and at the same time provide inspiration to
anyone else who truly cares about the future of our great Nation. I am
backed by %100 of Orca. Please vote for Thor Amundson, U.S. Senate

I believe the most important words of the United States
Constitution is “We The People”. Never before have we ever found this
country under attacks from foreign agencies to domestic terrorism. I
will be looking for other elected offi cials who share the same passion
for reforming and improving a better way of life for our country.
Correcting the social injustices, tax reform,  immigration, foreign
and domestic security issues and Single Payer Health Care Program.
These are all very important things for our country. I have a lot of
work ahead of me as your Senator. I am not a politician, I am a public
servant who never needed an elective seat to work for our Global
Community of humanity.  I am supporting Scientists in the United
States who have helped in engineering a plastic-eating enzyme that
will fight against pollution. I will protect Washington State policies
and laws that is continuously being dismantled by current executive
orders. We cannot ignore that our country is now in a state of
catastrophic crisis on all levels of government. Unity is strength and
without unity human civilization.  I encourage every voter to do the
research on each canidates. We cannot allow a handful of citizens
determine who they feel should represent a very diverse state.
Remember this election is not about me its about we.

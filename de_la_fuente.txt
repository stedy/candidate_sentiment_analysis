I am not a career Politian. I am just like you. I live in the
real world, not in the political one.
I don’t have to pretend to understand the minority issues because
I am one. I don’t have to pretend to understand how to create
jobs because I have created thousands. I don’t have to pretend to
understand the importance of paying a fair wage and providing
health care benefits because I’ve witnessed the impact it has on the
lives of the families of those I employed. I don’t have to pretend to
understand international relations because I’ve traveled extensively
and both lived and worked abroad. I don’t have to pretend to care
about the environment because I am actually doing something
about it through renewable energy. I don’t even have to pretend to
understand the cost of education...because I have five children.
And where I really differ: I don’t look at problems through a political
lens, I look at them though a practical one, using logic, my personal
and professional experience.
Our Nation is a crossroad. Einstein once said, “We cannot solve our
problems with the same thinking we used when we crated them.” I
would suggest that it’s also true that we cannot solve our problems
with the same people who create them. We’re suffering from political
gridlock fashioned by career politicians who placed party politics
ahead of the people.
Our elections process has been rigged to maintain the status quo. It’s
time for change, and I will do everything in my power to deliver it.

In 2000 Maria Cantwell and I ran for US senate my son
Hashem 18 years Old elected State Delegate helped my campaign. As
Democrat I am strong on progressive issues, conservative on social
issues.
70 years ago, my family was expelled from the Port City of Haifa
Palestine, as well as 700 hundred thousand Palestinians by Zionist
Jews, coming mostly from eastern European who had no connection
to Palestine.
President Trump transferring the American Embassy to Jerusalem is
fomenting a Religious war between Muslims and Jews worldwide as
both consider Jerusalem sacred. I tried to resolve this conflict on the
basis of stablishing a non-religious state in Historic Palestine, where
Jews, Muslims, and Christians can live together with equal rights
under a constitution similar to the U.S. This resolution was adopted by
Grant County Democratic convention four times. In 1990 I introduced
a resolution adopted at Democratic State Convention in Spokane,
to make the Middle East free of nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons. Israel is the only country who has nuclear weapons at the
Dimona nuclear facilities in the Negev desert.
On health care I am an expert see details in my Facebook
Dr.Mohammad Said. As an immigrant myself Spanish speaking, I
advocate to institute a guest worker program, so Latinos come to work
in the US leaving their families behind given enough time to go back to
visit. Amended Constitution to reform War Powers Act, National Guard
under State control and Second Amendment as privilege and not right,
foreign born American citizens able to run for president. Cut foreign
aid, former President Obama gave Israel 38 billion dollars from tax
payers in the next 10 years. No politician protested. Reign on military
not treat them as sacred cow, need to finance our infrastructure.

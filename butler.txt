My name is Jon Butler, I’m running for United States
Senator of Washington State. My platform is Family Court Reform,
Family Law Reform. I’ve been an advocate for 7 years helping Parents,
from here in Washington to around the country and the world.
Family Courts have destroyed families, dreams of children and their
parents for over a century. It started in 1910. It is time to stop the
abuse on Washingtonians and American Parents. I would also like
to build Mega shelters for the homeless vets,women and men. We
should have done this a long time ago as I have served out in the
community in this area. Also I would love to give teachers raises and
better incentives. They are the on our front line of our generations to
come, they are the military of our children. They should be treated
like the best! Furthermore something that has been on my heart is to,
limit terms on politicians. This has never been changed in history. It’s
time to make history and make that happen. There are other great
things I would love to get done for Washingtonians, from creating
stricter laws for pedophiles. To raising the speed limits. Plus to step
it up I’m not asking for any donations, I’m going to give half of the
pay check away to internatonal and local communities. Building
families up and the other half I will give out myself. I’m not asking
for any money. I am paying for this campaign myself. All I’m asking is
for
your vote

Washington, God-bless America

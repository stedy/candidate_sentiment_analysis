The American government is paralyzed by a political
system that forces binary choices. Democratic or Republican...both
parties are equally guilty, shameless and unaccountable for their
betrayal of the people. We can blame the current Administration
or the last one, but it truly does not matter. Neither political party
represents you or me. And that isn’t changing anytime soon.
Choosing the lesser of two evils is no longer a viable position to take
when filling out your ballot. Independent candidates and third parties
need real support from voters. Washington, DC must be reshaped in
the mold of other world capitals, where multiple parties and coalition
governments work together to form viable compromises.
No candidate for public office can or should try to satisfy everyone.
So let’s end the charade and stop looking for ideologically pure
individuals to agree with 100% on every topic. Instead, let’s embrace
differences in our backgrounds, philosophies, religions and
perspectives. Find common ground on issues and policies. No more
focusing on provocative rhetoric and media-driven conflict.
A little less conversation. A little more action.

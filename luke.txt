Government seems exempted from so many laws and
standards it subjects the people to? I believe all levels of government
entities should be subject to the same laws and standards it imposes
on the people.
Government has created so many technical crimes that harshly
incarcerate people when they haven’t hurt anybody else. Our
government has turned justice over to a police state and prison
industrial complex that is not interested in serving the people or their
rights, but instead feeds on the people. It should further be federally
enacted that it is allowable to record the actions of any government
servant (federal, state and local) being observed conducting official
and public acts without consent or prior notice to the servant.
Government accountability also starts with fiscal policy; the budget
must be balanced as to not continue the policy of saddling future
generations with unsustainable debt. All spending must be cut:
domestic, overseas, military and government operations, no sacred
cows. The budget gimmickry our government has fooled so many
people with for far too long must cease.
In order to cut the biggest expenditure, military spending, we must
scale back the mission of our troops to defendin g our shipping and
travel rights throughout the world along with protecting our territory.
Military intervention around the world without declaration of war
and the defending/policing of other nations is not only expensive
but there is no return on investment. The cost of American lives in all
this conflict is too high and for that there can never be a return on
investment. “We the People” have allowed our government to misuse
and abuse our loyal soldiers. Our military has not failed us but “We
the People” have failed them, that needs to change immediately. That
begins with bringing our people home!

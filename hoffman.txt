 Striking teachers are showing that working people have
power if we stick together. I aim to bring that solidarity and strength
to Congress.
As a union representative at a Seattle community college, I see
coworkers struggle as our wages lose ground to inflation. They
commute for hours because they can’t afford to live near the city.
Meanwhile, unemployment remains high in rural Washington.
Nationally, public services are slashed while one in eight people, and
one in four children, live in poverty.
Such is life under our profit-crazed economic system, administered
by the millionaires of the two main political parties, who support
war after war and faithfully serve the interest of the billionaires. I
am
running because working people need someone in D.C. who will fight
for them and offer solutions that will serve their interests --
solutions
like public ownership of the banks in order to finance affordable
housing and infrastructure. Let’s also redirect military spending and
tax the rich so we can establish programs to guarantee jobs for all,
while funding free education, healthcare, senior care, childcare, and
sane environmental policies.
As an antiwar veteran, I will push to close U.S. military bases globally
and retrain soldiers to serve hard-pressed communities at home. I will
oppose privatization of the Veterans Administration.
On my job, I help members, especially women, as they stand up to
bullying. I will demand federal policies, including affirmative
action, to
stop sexual harassment and discrimination of every sort. I will work
to strengthen the ability to organize unions, and to end immigration
raids that terrorize immigrant communities. ¡Sí se puede!
